Advanced Custom Fields - State Field add-on
===============

This add-on is meant to work with the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) WordPress plugin and adds a State field type that will provide a drop down list of US states.  If ACF is not installed this plugin will not do anything.


Installation
------------
1. Download the plugin and extract it to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. Done - a new field type will now be available when adding custom fields.
